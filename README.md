## Preparing to run the code
Before you run the main code, build the sleep command application:

`make build`

## Running the code
Once the `/bin` folder contains the executable, you're ready to run the code:
`make run`

Since the main function contains calls to all functions, feel free to comment out and run each separately to view less output at a time.
